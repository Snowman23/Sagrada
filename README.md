# 🎲 Sagrada (C)

A C implementation of the board game **Sagrada**, built as a terminal-based project for practicing low-level programming and game logic.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a console-based version of the colorful dice-drafting game *Sagrada*. It mimics core gameplay mechanics such as:

- Window pattern selection
- Dice placement with color/number constraints
- Round structure with public and private objectives
- Tool card usage

The game logic and state management are written entirely in C, making this a fun exploration of data structures, pointers, and memory management.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🧩 Pattern grid & constraints
- 🎲 Dice drafting system
- 🃏 Tool card mechanics
- 📜 Public and private objectives
- 👥 Basic multiplayer turn handling (local)

## 🛠 Built With

- **Language:** C
- **Compilation:** `gcc`
- **Terminal UI:** ASCII rendering

##🤓 Motivation
Sagrada was a way to combine my love for board games with my interest in systems-level programming. It helped solidify concepts like:

- Memory handling in C

- Structuring code in large C projects

- Handling state machines and turn-based flow

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snowman23/Sagrada.git
   cd Sagrada
